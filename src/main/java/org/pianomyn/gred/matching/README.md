## Notes (For myself so I don't forget!)
- Pattern matching with well optimized pattern matching algorithms. Currently implemented
    - <u><b>Rabin-Karp</b></u>
        - Average Case: O(m + n) Assuming a good hash function that avoids collisions.
        - Worst Case: O(mn) If there are many collisions.
        - Uses a rolling hash (usually moving sum) to avoid pointless checks. Hard to pick a good rolling hash that balances correctness and speed.
    - <u><b>Boyer-Moore</b></u> ([Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xyhb72LCX4&t=200s))
        - Average Case: O(n/m) esp when |alphabet| >> |unique_pattern_chars| as the Bad Character rule will often trigger large jumps.
        - Worst Case: O(mn) eg if pattern and text are all same characters. Can guarantee linear bound with Apostolico-Giancarlo version (Not implemented).
        - Precomputation on the pattern to skip redundant matches. Take the best of the 2 suggestions.
        - <b>Bad Char Table Precomputation</b> (Skip until mismatch becomes match):
            - Right to left
            - Classic approach is to use map to track last index occurrence. Less space, worse time complexity. Alternatively, create a matrix of size `pattern_length` * `|alphabet|`.
            - For each i in range \[0, pattern_length\], compute the distance that each character in the alphabet was last seen based on i-1.
        - <b>Good Suffix Table Precomputation</b> ([Primer](https://medium.com/@neethamadhu.ma/good-suffix-rule-in-boyer-moore-algorithmType-explained-simply-9d9b6d20a773) Don't turn any existing matches into a mismatch)
            - Right to left
            - Case 1 (Weak): The **entire suffix matched before the mismatch** occurs **elsewhere in the pattern**.
                - Shift the pattern so that this earlier occurrence of the suffix lines up with the text.
            - Case 2 (Strong): A **proper suffix** of the matched part is also a **prefix** of the pattern.
                - Shift the pattern so that this prefix lines up with the suffix in the text.
            - A shift table is computed using both cases to determine how far the pattern can be safely shifted on a mismatch, **while preserving suffix matches**.
    - <u><b>KMP</b></u> (WIP)
        - Average Case: O(n)
        - Worst Case: O(m + n)
        - <b>Last Prefix Suffix</b>: Precomputation on the pattern to skip redundant matches.
            - Computation
                - Create an array of size `pattern_length` called `lps`.
                - Use 2 pointers, `left` and `right` and start both at 0.
                - If `pattern[right]` == `pattern[left]`, Set `lps`
